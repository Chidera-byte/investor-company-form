# Investor Company Signup and Signin Forms

## Overview
This project consists of the development and design of **Signup** and **Signin** forms for an investor company. Both forms are designed to provide a seamless and secure user experience and are essential components of the platform's user authentication system.

## Structure and Components
Each form includes the following key sections:

- **Header:**  
  The header provides a welcoming introduction and can be customized to include the company logo and branding elements.

- **Form:**  
  The core of each page, where users enter their information. The signup form collects details such as full name, email address, password, and optional company information, while the signin form requires just the email and password.

- **Submit Button:**  
  Prominently displayed, the submit button allows users to submit their information. On clicking, the forms perform client-side validation before proceeding with server-side submission.

- **Footer:**  
  The footer contains essential links and additional information, maintaining consistency across the pages and enhancing navigation.

## Design and Development
- **Technologies Used:**  
  - **HTML5:** Used for structuring the forms and ensuring semantic clarity.
  - **CSS3:** Applied for styling, including layout, color schemes, and responsive design, to ensure the forms look great on devices of all sizes.
  - **Bootstrap 4:** Leveraged to implement a responsive grid system, consistent form styling, and built-in components like buttons and tooltips.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Both forms are fully responsive, adapting smoothly to various screen sizes from desktops to mobile devices.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  The forms are designed with a focus on user experience, featuring clear instructions, intuitive layouts, and error handling.

- **Consistency:**  
  The use of Bootstrap 4 ensures a consistent look and feel across the forms, enhancing the overall user experience and maintaining brand coherence.
